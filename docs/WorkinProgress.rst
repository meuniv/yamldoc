Work in progress and future utilities
-------------------------------------

Yaml2LMS is a hack. It is not perfect but it gets the job done in many cases.

There are many things that can be improved (send your suggestions to `me`_).

Here is a list of things I'm working on:

1) Improved spellchecker
2) Better management of latex packages
3) Possibility of reading mutilple question files
4) Create readthedocs questionnaires for learning
