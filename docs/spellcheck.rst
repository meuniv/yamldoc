Spellchecking
+++++++++++++

.. Note:: This features remains in development but can be useful to identify basic typos.

Usage
-----
When you use the :code:`spellcheck: yes` in the :code:`config.yaml` file, *yam2lms* will perform a spellcheck of the questions. Currently, the script uses the python library provided in the :code:`spellchecker` module.

The script will check all words in the document and provide a corrected version called :code:`XXX_SPELLCHECKED.pdf` file. Using the example provided in :ref:`my-reference-label`, we get the result shown below.

Notes
-----
1. The process is slow. Once you have run this and corrected your mistake, turn this off to avoid lenghty processing.
2. *yaml2lms* does not make any correction; instead it makes suggestions as shown in the exmaple below. In this example, most of the mistakes found are actually **not** mistakes and it is expected each user will look into this separately. Only one word was correctly flagged as incorrect.
