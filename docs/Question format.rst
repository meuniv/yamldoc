YAML Format (input)
+++++++++++++++++++
Each question is provided in `yaml` format. The format is somewhat unforgiving as spacings and alignments need to be correct for the file to be readable. Below is an example of simple question using this format. Each line will be described in details.

Question example
----------------
.. code-block:: yaml
  :linenos:

     - Type: MC
       Text: >-
        In the screencast we derived an expression for the Fermi-Dirac distribution 
        using the grand canonical ensemble. What is the grand canonical ensemble?
       Size: Auto
       Points: 2
       Answers:
	- Choice:  >-
            The ensemble of systems with fixed energy and entropy.
          Validity: incorrect
	- Choice: >-
            The ensemble of systems with fixed energy and chemical potential.
          Validity: incorrect
	- Choice: 'The ensemble of systems with fixed temperature and chemical potential.'
          Validity: correct
	Skip: 'no'
	Note: question regarding lecture 29 

Anatomy of a question
---------------------
	
We will now review each line. Basically, all name that are followed by ":" is a key in a dictionary. If you wish to use a ":" in your questions or answers, you need to use quotation marks (or the :code:`>-` sign -- it is usually used for text with multiple lines).

1. New question starts with the type. 

.. code-block:: yaml

   - Type: MC		

Each new question starts with a :code:`- Type:` keyword. The options are: :code:`MC` (Multiple Choice), :code:`MA` (Multiple Answers),...

2. Description of the question itself.

.. code-block:: yaml

   - Text: 'This is my question'


or

.. code-block:: yaml

   - Text: >-
      This is a multiline question with various parts in it.
      Try it if you want to. 


.. Tip:: The advantage of this appraoch is that you can use Latex commands in both text and math modes in all the texts used in the yaml file.

3. For multiple-choice questions, you then have the list of possible answers: 

.. code-block:: yaml

   Answers:
	- Choice:  >-
            The ensemble of systems with fixed energy and entropy.
          Validity: incorrect	 
	 
Each Choice can be entered in a single-line or multiline format. There is a second keyword called :code:`Validity` (case sensitive) to assign an `incorrect` or `correct` attribute to the choice. Note that you only need to provide the information for a *correct* asnwer as the script will assign an *incorrect* attribute by default.

- Note 1: You can list as many *Choice* lines as you need.
- Note 2: For some types of questions, only one answer can have the :code:`Validity: correct` attribute.

4. You can skip the question from the file without deleting it by using: :code:`Skip: 'no'` (this is an optional keyword)

5. To keep things tidy, you can add a note for each question, using the :code:`Note:` keyword. 


.. hint:: A good habit is to check your `yaml` file using a free online
       tool such as those provided by onlineyamltools.com (see, here: https://onlineyamltools.com/validate-yaml). After a while you won't make a mistake anymore but early on, this could be frustrating.
